Asthma symptoms vary from person to person, but some key signs should not be ignored. The most common symptom is difficulty in breathing, especially during physical activity or at night. Many people experience a persistent cough that worsens early in the morning or at bedtime. Wheezing, a high-pitched whistling sound while exhaling, is another classic sign of asthma. Chest tightness or pressure that feels like a band around the chest may also occur. These symptoms are often triggered by exposure to allergens like dust, pollen, smoke, or strong odors. In children, frequent coughing, reduced energy levels, and trouble sleeping are warning signals of asthma. Some people may experience only occasional mild symptoms, while others may face daily breathing difficulties. In severe cases, asthma attacks can lead to emergency situations where immediate medical care is needed. Recognizing these symptoms early helps in getting timely treatment and avoiding complications. If you or your child show these signs repeatedly, it is important to consult a specialist. More details here: https://careandcurehospital.co.in/asthma-management-ahmedabad/
